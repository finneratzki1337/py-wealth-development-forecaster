# Wealth Development Forecaster

An interactive Dash application for modelling 30-year wealth development across three market scenarios. The simulator follows the requirements in `specs.txt`, providing reproducible scenario analysis, inflation-aware metrics, and XLSX export.

## Features

- Block-wise return modelling with stochastic monthly sampling and fee drag.
- Inflation process with yearly draws and monthly expansion.
- Cash-flow controls for initial wealth, monthly contributions, and annual step-ups.
- Nine paths per run (three scenarios Ã— three seeds) with scenario averages and bands.
- Withdrawal analytics (perpetuity and 30-year annuity) including tax drag.
- Validation warnings for suspect inputs and deterministic run hashing.
- Downloadable Excel workbook containing raw paths and aggregate tables.

## Getting Started
