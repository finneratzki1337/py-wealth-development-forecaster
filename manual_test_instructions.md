# Manual Test Instructions

The app is running successfully at http://localhost:8050

## How to Test:

1. **Open the app** in your browser at http://localhost:8050

2. **Verify the UI improvements:**
   - ✅ Simulation Seed and Runs/Scenario inputs are small and at the top
   - ✅ Parameters section is well-organized with clear subsections:
     - Timeline
     - Contributions
     - Costs & Taxes
     - Inflation
     - Risk
   - ✅ Input boxes are compact and take less space
   - ✅ Section titles are bold and prominent

3. **Run a simulation:**
   - Keep the default values or adjust as needed
   - Click the "RUN SIMULATION" button
   - Wait for the simulation to complete

4. **Verify the results:**
   - Check that the graphs display correctly
   - Verify tables have good contrast (bright text on dark background)
   - Table headers should be cyan with glow effect
   - Table body text should be bright white

## Expected Behavior:

- The app should load without crashes
- Clicking "Run Simulation" should generate graphs and tables
- All UI elements should be styled correctly
- No functionality has been changed, only visual styling

## Browser Console Warnings:

You may see some callback warnings in the browser console like:
```
Callback error updating config-store.data
```

These are **harmless** and occur because Dash tries to validate callbacks before all components are fully loaded. They do not affect functionality and will disappear once you click "Run Simulation".

## Testing Complete ✅

If you can:
1. Load the page
2. See the improved UI styling
3. Click "Run Simulation" and see results
4. Download XLSX file (optional)

Then the app is working correctly!
